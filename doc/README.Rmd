```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This repo contains example files to show how to automate table creation with kableExtra and LaTeX.

There are two parts:

1. Create the table in R with `kable()` and saves as a `.tex` file. See `make-latex-table.R` for an example.
1. `\input{}` that `.tex` file into the LaTeX manuscript. See `doc/manuscript.tex` for an example.
